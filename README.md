# Synthicide System

![Foundry v11](https://img.shields.io/badge/foundry-v11-green) ![Foundry v12](https://img.shields.io/badge/foundry-v12-green)

This system is a draft version of a Synthicide system that is based on v13 Boilerplate. It's similar to Simple World-building, but has examples of creating attributes in code rather than dynamically through the UI.


### Getting Help

Check out the [Official Foundry VTT Discord](https://discord.gg/foundryvtt)! The #system-development channel has helpful pins and is a good place to ask questions about any part of the foundry application.

For more static references, the [Knowledge Base](https://foundryvtt.com/kb/) and [API Documentation](https://foundryvtt.com/api/) provide different levels of detail. For the most detail, you can find the client side code in your foundry installation location. Classes are documented in individual files under `resources/app/client` and `resources/app/common`, and the code is collated into a single file at `resources/app/public/scripts/foundry.js`.

#### Tutorial

For much more information on how to use this system as a starting point for making your own, see the [full tutorial on the Foundry Wiki](https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/development/guides/SD-tutorial)!

Note: Tutorial may be out of date, so look out for the Foundry compatibility badge at the top of each page.

## Sheet Layout

This system includes a handful of helper CSS classes to help you lay out your sheets if you're not comfortable diving into CSS fully. Those are:

- `flexcol`: Included by Foundry itself, this lays out the child elements of whatever element you place this on vertically.
- `flexrow`: Included by Foundry itself, this lays out the child elements of whatever element you place this on horizontally.
- `flex-center`: When used on something that's using flexrow or flexcol, this will center the items and text.
- `flex-between`: When used on something that's using flexrow or flexcol, this will attempt to place space between the items. Similar to "justify" in word processors.
- `flex-group-center`: Add a border, padding, and center all items.
- `flex-group-left`: Add a border, padding, and left align all items.
- `flex-group-right`: Add a border, padding, and right align all items.
- `grid`: When combined with the `grid-Ncol` classes, this will lay out child elements in a grid.
- `grid-Ncol`: Replace `N` with any number from 1-12, such as `grid-3col`. When combined with `grid`, this will layout child elements in a grid with a number of columns equal to the number specified.
